                <h3>Data Relationships</h3>
                <p>The BookBridge database is built on a well-structured relational model to support efficient tracking and interaction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Users → Books:</strong> A single user can list multiple books for sharing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Books → Borrow Records:</strong> Each book can be borrowed multiple times, with every instance recorded.</li>
                    <li><strong>Users → Borrow Records:</strong> Each borrow record links both the borrower and the owner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Books → Reviews:</strong> Multiple users can review the same book, providing feedback and ratings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Users → Reviews:</strong> Users can write reviews for different books they have interacted with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Books → Book Images:</strong> Each book can have multiple images, with one marked as primary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Users → Preferences:</strong> Each user has a single preferences record storing favorite genres and notification settings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This relational setup enables BookBridge to handle user activity, book details, borrowing history, visual content, and personalized experiences effectively.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges We Faced</h2>
            <div class="card mission-card">
                <h3>1. Synchronizing Team Contributions</h3>
                <p>With four members working on different aspects (frontend, backend, CRUD, data viz), keeping code in sync was a major hurdle. Merge conflicts and version mismatches slowed progress initially.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We implemented a Git workflow with dedicated branches for each feature and scheduled regular merges through pull requests. This minimized conflicts and improved collaboration.</p>

                <h3>2. Real-time Data Binding for Updates</h3>
                <p>Creating an update feature where book details auto-populate on selection was tricky to implement without a full-page reload.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We used JavaScript to serialize book data and populate form fields dynamically on selection, improving user experience.</p>

                <h3>3. Designing a Scalable Data Model</h3>
                <p>We needed a data model that could support multiple users, books, reviews, borrowing history, and images without performance issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The team collaboratively designed a normalized logical data model using entity relationships and ensured referential integrity through foreign keys.</p>

                <h3>4. Ensuring Accessibility and Usability</h3>
                <p>Designing an intuitive and accessible UI for users with varying tech experience was challenging.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Priyanka led user interface testing with feedback loops and simplified form designs with validations to enhance usability for all age groups.</p>
